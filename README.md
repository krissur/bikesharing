## Summary

After review of the data, my analysis is that the majority of bikers are male subscribers that use the bike share program to commute to and from work. 
The females in this data appear to use the bike shares more leisurely. 
For this to be a successful investment in Des Moines, I would ask the following questions
*	Does downtown area show enough potential to allow for these types of commuters?
*	Does the type and number of tourists in the downtown area support this generating enough clients with or without work commuters?
*	What are population numbers in Des Moines compared to NYC?


My analysis is this bike sharing works mainly because of the work commuters.
